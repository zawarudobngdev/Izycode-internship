# Handwritten Digit Classification Model

### A model made for the Izycode Machine Learning Internship Program

This is a model that recognizes handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset, a foundational task in image classification. It accurately classifies images of handwritten digits, setting the stage for more advanced image
recognition applications.

I have separeted this task into 3 steps across 3 notebooks to better showcase the developing process.
